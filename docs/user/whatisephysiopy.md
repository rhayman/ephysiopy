# What is ephysiopy?

This is a Python package that provides a set of tools for the analysis of electrophysiological data.

It enables the loading of elepctrophysiology data recorded with either OpenEphys or Axona systems, and to perform basic analysis on them. It also provides tools for the visualization of the data, such as rate maps and spike raster plots and some limited tools for power spectral density analysis.

## What it isn't

It does *not* provide tools for spike sorting, or for managing different spike sorters/ classifiers. There are plenty of other packages out there that do that, and I am not interested in reinventing the wheel.
